### This is Lim Seong-ryong, a developer exploring a better path.

Dig into the essence of the problem and present a 'better path'.
It does not simply overcome the bottlenecks and inefficiencies encountered in the development process.
Enjoy the process of analyzing and improving root causes to reduce latency by 0.1 seconds and streamline system resources.

Expand the potential of your business with the depth of technology.
It's not just about implementing the functionality, it's constantly asking, "Why do you need this technology?"
